<p>
  Towards safety assessment based on human data. Imagine a world in which we
  perform precision safety testing of chemicals and pharmaceuticals without
  using laboratory animals. Imagine that the safety of chemicals and
  pharmaceuticals can be assessed for vulnerable groups such as infants, the
  elderly, or the diseased. Imagine that we know how these substances interact
  with human biology and physiology and how they can be used safely at home,
  school, or at work during the course of our lives. This is our vision for the
  future, the vision that underlies the development of the Virtual Human
  Platform for Safety Assessment, VHP4Safety.

  Towards Safety Assessment Based on Human Data
</h2>

<p>
  The mission of the Virtual Human Platform is to improve the prediction of the
  potential harmful effects of chemicals and pharmaceuticals based on a
  holistic, interdisciplinary definition of human health by developing the
  Virtual Human Platform and accelerating the transition from animal-based
  testing to innovative safety assessment. The Virtual Human Platform integrates
  data on human physiology, chemical characteristics, and perturbations of
  biological pathways, for the first time in an inclusive and integrated manner
  that incorporates:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Human-relevant scenarios to discriminate vulnerable groups, such as disease
    state, life course exposure, gender, and age
  </li>
  <li>
    Chemicals from different sectors: pharma, consumer products, and chemical
    industry
  </li>
  <li>Different regulatory and stakeholder needs</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The Virtual Human Platform addresses the emerging societal challenge of the
  transition to animal-free safety assessment, by integrating various scientific
  disciplines in the consortium and working with all stakeholders towards
  implementation and societal acceptance of an approach to chemical safety
  assessment that is based on human data rather than animal data.

  Moving Away from Animal Experimentation
</h2>

<p>
  Current legal and regulatory frameworks for the assessment of the safety of
  chemicals and pharmaceuticals for human health rely predominantly on data from
  in vivo animal studies. However, the accuracy of animal studies to predict
  toxicity in humans is limited. In addition, current animal testing regimes do
  not reflect human-relevant scenarios, such as differences in susceptibility
  due to age, sex, timing of exposure, or disease state. The Virtual Human
  Platform will be developed within three interacting research lines (RL):
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>RL1:</strong> Building the platform</li>
  <li><strong>RL2:</strong> Feeding the platform with newly generated data</li>
  <li>
    <strong>RL3:</strong> Implementing the platform to ensure stakeholders’
    acceptance, governance, and sustainability
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In a national and international arena urgently calling for the reduction of
  animal testing, the current approach to gradually refine, reduce, and replace
  animal testing has not led to the necessary and desired pace of innovation in
  animal-free safety assessment. Furthermore, the opportunities offered by
  state-of-the-art technologies in human health and data science have hardly
  been explored in the realm of safety assessment.
</p>

<p>
  VHP4Safety is a research project funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO)
  programme entitled the ‘Dutch Research Agenda: Research on Routes by Consortia
  (NWA‐ORC).’ With a budget of over 10 million Euros, the project started on
  June 1, 2021, and will last for the duration of 5 years.
